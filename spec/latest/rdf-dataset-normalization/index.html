  <p>RDF [[RDF-CONCEPTS]] describes a graph-based data model for making claims
    about the world and provides the foundation for reasoning upon that graph
    of information. At times, it becomes necessary to compare the differences
    between datasets of graphs, digitally sign them, or generate short
    identifiers for graphs via hashing algorithms. This document outlines an
    algorithm for normalizing RDF datasets such that these operations can be
    performed.</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>When data scientists discuss normalization, they do so in the context of
    achieving a particular set of goals. Since the same information may
    sometimes be expressed in a variety of different ways, it often becomes
    necessary to be able to transform each of these different ways into a
    single, standard format. With a standard format, the differences between
    two different sets of data can be easily determined, a
    cryptographically-strong hash identifier can be generated for a particular
    set of data, and a particular set of data may be digitally-signed for later
    verification.</p>

  <p>In particular, this specification is about normalizing
    <tref>RDF dataset</tref>s, which are collections of graphs. Since
    a directed graph can express the same information in more than one
    way, it requires normalization to achieve the aforementioned goals
    and any others that may arise via surrendipity.</p>

  <p>Most <tref>RDF dataset</tref> can be normalized fairly quickly, in terms
    of algorithmic time complexity. However, those that contain nodes that do
    not have globally unique identifiers pose a greater challenge. Normalizing
    these datasets presents the <tdef>graph isomorphism</tdef> problem, a
    problem that is believed to be difficult to solve quickly. More formally,
    it is believed to be an NP-Intermediate problem, that is, neither known to
    be solvable in polynomial time nor NP-complete. Fortunately, existing real
    world data is rarely modeled in a way that manifests this problem and new
    data can be modeled to avoid it. In fact, software systems can detect a
    problematic dataset and may choose to assume it's an attempted denial of
    service attack, rather than a real input, and abort.</p>

  <p>This document outlines an algorithm for generating a normalized
    <tref>RDF dataset</tref> given an <tref>RDF dataset</tref> as input. The
    algorithm is called the
    <strong>Universal RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm 2015</strong> or
    <strong>URDNA2015</strong>.</p>

  <h1>Normalization</h1>

  <p class="issue">This algorithm is a work in progress, do not implement it.</p>

  <p>Normalization is the process of transforming an <tref>input dataset</tref>
    to a <tref>standard dataset</tref>. That is, for two
    <tref>input dataset</tref>s containing the same information, regardless
    of their arrangement, will be transformed into identical
    <tref>standard dataset</tref>s. The problem is a fairly difficult technical
    problem to solve because it requires directed graphs to be deterministically
    ordered into sets of nodes and edges. This is easy to do when all of the
    nodes have globally unique names, but difficult to do when some of the nodes
    are not labeled. Any unlabeled nodes must be deterministically labeled.</p>

  <p>In time, there may be more than one normalization algorithm and,
    therefore, for identification purposes, this algorithm is named the
    "Universal RDF Datset Normalization Algorithm 2015"
    (<abbr title="Universal RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm 2015">URDNA2015</abbr>).</p>

         First it is used to temporarily name nodes during the normalization

         exist as well as the names that will be generated by the normalization
         algorithm. Second, it will eventually be set to <code>_:c14n</code> to
         generate the final, deterministic labels for nodes in the graph. This
         prefix will be concatenated with the <tref>labeling counter</tref> to
         produce a node <tref>label</tref>. For example, <code>_:j8r3k</code> is

    <h2>Hash Paths</h2>

    <p class="issue">TODO</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>Usually, when trying to determine if two nodes in a graph are
        equivalent, you simply compare their identifiers. However, what if the
        nodes don't have identifiers? Then you must determine if the two nodes
        have equivalent connections to equivalent nodes all throughout the
        whole graph. This is called the graph isomorphism problem. This
        algorithm approaches this problem by considering how one might draw
        a graph on paper. You can test to see if two nodes are equivalent
        by drawing the graph twice. The first time you draw the graph the
        first node is drawn in the center of the page. If you can draw the
        graph a second time such that it looks just like the first, except
        the second node is in the center of the page, then the nodes are
        equivalent. This algorithm essentially defines a determinitsic way to
        draw a graph where, if you begin with a particular node, the graph
        will always be drawn the same way. If two graphs are drawn the same way
        with two different nodes, then the nodes are equivalent. A hash is used
        to indicate a particular way that the graph has been drawn and can
        be used to compare nodes.</p>

      <p>This algorithm works in concert with the main normalization algorithm
        to produce a unique, deterministic identifier for a particular blank
        node. This hash incorporates all of the information that is connected
        to the blank node as well as how it is connected. It does this by
        creating deterministic paths that emanate out from the blank node
        through any other adjacent blank nodes. The process is as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start by taking the perspective that the <tref>blank node</tref> is
          at the center of the graph. This is the starting point for which all
          paths will radiate outward.</li>
        <li>Create a <tref>blank node labeler</tref> and assign a label
          to the starting <tref>blank node</tref>.</li>
        <li>Start the main message digest hash.</li>
        <li>For each adjacent <tref>blank node</tref>, determine a label for
          it, first using the canonical label if already assigned, second
          using the label from the local <tref>blank node labeler</tref> if
          already assigned, and lastly, use the result of the
          <a href="#hash-quads">Hash Quads algorithm</a> as the label.</li>
        <li>Create a group message digest hash, digesting data representing
          the direction of the <tref>blank node</tref> relationship (subject
          to object or object from subject) relative to the original
          <tref>blank node</tref>, the predicate, and the
          <tref>blank node</tref> label. Store a record of this group hash
          and its matching <tref>blank node</tref>.</li>
        <li>Now iterate over each of the group hashes and related
          <tref>blank node</tref>s. For each group, use the main hash to
          digest the group hash and create a copy of the
          <tref>blank node labeler</tref> to be used in case recursion is
          needed. Then, proceed to construct a path. For each permutation of
          <tref>blank node</tref>s in the group, concatenate the canonical
          label for it, if already assigned, to the path. If not, and the
          <tref>blank node labeler</tref> has not assigned it a label, take
          note of this and then assign it one. If a path has already been
          selected as the canonical path, stop permutating.</li>
        <li>If no path has been chosen as the canonical one, recurse into
          each of the <tref>blank node</tref>s that was assigned a label
          in the previous step, passing the copy of the
          <tref>blank node labeler</tref> to use in the algorithm. Append the
          resulting hash of the recursion to the path and update the reference
          to the copy of the <tref>blank node labeler</tref> to the one
          given in the result of the algorithm.</li>
        <li>If no path has been chosen or the current path is shorter than
          the currently chosen path, update the chosen path to the current
          path. Set the chosen namer to match the one used to produce the
          path.</li>
        <li>Use the main hash to digest the chosen path and return it
          and the chosen namer as the result of the algorithm.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <p class="issue">When processing adjacent blank nodes, can they be skipped
      if they've already been canonically labeled?</p>

    <p class="issue">When creating group hashes, does the graph name also
      need to be digested (not just direction of relationship, predicate,
      and blank node label)? It may not be necessary as any structural
      differences would get picked up by the Hash Quads algorithm or by
      recursion. If there are no differences then it won't matter because
      the same hash will be produced anyway.

    <h4>Serialization Label Generation Algorithm</h4>

    <p class="issue">This algorithm is out-of-date, don't implement it.</p>

    <p>
    The algorithm generates a <tref>serialization label</tref> given a
    <tref>label</tref> and a <tref>mapping state</tref> and returns the
    <tref>serialization label</tref>.
    </p>

    <ol class="algorithm">
      <li>If the <tref>label</tref> is already in the
        <tref>serialization labels map</tref>, return its associated value.
      </li>
      <li>If the <tref>label</tref> starts with the string <code>_:c14n</code>,
        the <tref>serialization label</tref> is the letter <code>c</code>
        followed by the number that follows <code>_:c14n</code> in the
        <tref>label</tref>.
      </li>
      <li>Otherwise, the <tref>serialization label</tref> is the
        letter <code>s</code> followed by the string value of
        <tref>mapping counter</tref>. Increment the <tref>mapping counter</tref> by
        <code>1</code>.
      </li>
      <li>Create a new key-value pair in the <tref>serialization labels map</tref>
        where the key is the <tref>label</tref> and the value is the
        generated <tref>serialization label</tref>.
